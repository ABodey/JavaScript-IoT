JavaScript IoT Workshop
===

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are lots of fun! But wouldn't it be better if we could write _JavaScript_ to run on our devices. Instead of hacking through C and Arduino, we could use the language we know and love to power our little mini-robots.

## Workshop

Come join us for this half-day workshop as we walk through setting up and using a JavaScript enabled device. We'll being using a NodeMCU board with an ESP8266 chip that we'll be flashing with the Espruino JavaScript runtime.

Workshop fee includes the wifi-enabled hardware, development board and led lights. You'll learn how to use JavaScript to:

1. Contact a server via http for posting data and getting updates
1. Make the lights blink (or any other controls or sensors) through the device API

Attendees should have a basic understanding of JavaScript and will benefit from some familiarity with the [NodeJS http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html).

## Schedule

The workshop will start promptly at 10:00am and run until 3:00pm, with a break for lunch from 12:00pm - 1:00pm (lunch is not provided, but there are many options within a few minutes walk).

## Location

Held at Alchemy Code Lab located across from Powell's Book Store at 30 NW 10th Ave.
