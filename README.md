JavaScript IoT Workshop
===

Internet of Things devices are lots of fun! But wouldn't it be better if we could write _JavaScript_ to run on our devices. Instead of hacking through C and Arduino, we could use the language we know and love to power are little mini-robots.

Come join us as we walk through setting up an `<insert device here>` and how to:

1. Contact a server via http for posting data and getting updates
1. Make the lights blink (or any other controls we have attached to our devices)
