# Basic Electronics, and flashing an LED


## Basic electronics

By this time, you will have received a kit.  What's in this kit is:

- NodeMCU microcontroller
- solderless breadboard
- LEDs
- resistors
- jumper wires
- buttons
- USB cable

We will go over how to interconnect all these pieces, what they are, what they do.



### LED

A light emitting diode is a chunk of silicon that converts electricity directly to light.  It has two pins, a cathode and an anode, and needs a resistor to regulate the voltage.  

Less technically, we apply power to it, and it glows, so long as the positive power goes to the long pin, and stick a resistor inline somewhere in the chain.

### Resistors

Resistors increase resistance (who knew!?).  For us, we're just gonna stick in next to the LED.
